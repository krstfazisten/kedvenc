                href="https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti" target="_blank" id="Ettore_link">Ettore Bugatti</a>,
            quickly became synonymous with luxury, performance, and design excellence. The brand initially focused on
            creating high-performance cars with intricate engineering and stunning aesthetics. Bugatti’s vehicles became
            renowned for their success in racing, particularly with models like the Type 35, which dominated in the
            1920s. </p>

        <p>After Ettore's death in 1947, the brand faced financial struggles and changed ownership multiple times. In
            the 1990s, Volkswagen acquired Bugatti, revitalizing it with the launch of the Veyron in 2005—a
            groundbreaking supercar known for its speed and engineering.</p>
